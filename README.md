# Thyroid-Cancer-reoccurrence-prediction

**IN SCOPE**

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

o Compile information about age, gender, smoking status, medical history (includingradiation and smoking), thyroid function, physical examination findings, adenopathy, pathology results, tumor features (risk, localization), and cancer staging for individualswho have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. o To deal with missing numbers, outliers, and inconsistencies, clean up and preprocessthe data. 2. Feature Selection and Engineering:

o Identify relevant features that may influence the recurrence of thyroid cancer basedon medical literature and expert knowledge. o Engineer new features if necessary, such as combining existing features or creatinginteraction terms. 3. Model Selection and Training:

o Consider the type of data and the nature of the problem as you examine several
regression models that can be used to predict the recurrence of cancer. Alongwithmore traditional methods like Lasso, Ridge, and Linear regression, learn about moresophisticated regression techniques like Gradient Boosting, and RandomForest
regression. Utilize techniques like cross-validation to assess the model's performancein order to prevent overfitting. 4. Evaluation and Validation:


o To understand the main factors influencing the recurrence of thyroid cancer, analyzethe regression model's coefficients or feature importance scores. Give medical
professionals information on risk variables that can be changed as well as thosethatcannot be changed that are linked to thyroid cancer recurrence.

**OutScope:**

1. Detailed analysis of treatment modalities and their impact on recurrence (unless directlycaptured in the provided data).

2. Long-term follow-up analysis beyond the scope of the provided dataset.

**Key Deliverables:**
   
1. Regression Model for Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction:
   
o Final trained regression model capable of predicting the likelihood of thyroidcancerrecurrence based on patient demographics, medical history, tumor characteristics, andstaging information.

2. Model Performance Evaluation Report:
   
o Comprehensive report detailing the performance metrics of the regressionmodel, including MSE, R-squared, and any other relevant evaluation metrics.

3. Feature Importance Analysis:

o Summary of the most influential features contributing to thyroid cancer recurrenceprediction, providing insights for medical professionals and researchers.

4. Project Documentation:
   
o Documentation outlining the methodology, data preprocessing steps, featureselectionprocess, model training approach, and evaluation procedures for reproducibilityandfuture reference.
